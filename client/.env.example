# Example environment variables for the Vite frontend
# Copy this file to `.env.local` (not committed) and adjust values.
# Vite will expose any variable prefixed with VITE_ to the client bundle.

# Base API endpoint (MUST include the path your backend expects, e.g. /api).
# No automatic /api appending is performed now.
# Production example: https://api.convocationmedal.ccsuniversity.ac.in/api
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

# Optional: Explicit origin for uploaded files. If unset, it falls back to the ORIGIN
# (protocol + host + port) of VITE_API_URL (ignoring any path like /api). Set this if
# you serve static uploads from a different domain/CDN.
# Example: https://api.convocationmedal.ccsuniversity.ac.in
